# 👋 Hi, I'm Ben Dulavitch  
**A Creative Junior Software Developer Blending the Arts and Technology**  
🌐 [bendulavitch.netlify.app](bendulavitch.netlify.app)

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a junior full-stack developer with a passion for using technology to create and enhance meaningful experiences. My journey into tech is a unique blend of the creative world of filmmaking and the technical realm of software development, where I apply my skills to build innovative, user-centered applications.

I completed Tech Elevator’s intensive 14-week coding bootcamp, where I honed my skills in Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, and front-end technologies like React and Vue.js. My diverse background, which spans over seven years in academia as a teaching assistant and experience in film production, gives me a strong foundation in creative problem-solving, collaboration, and leadership.

As I transitioned into software development, I discovered that both fields share common ground: an emphasis on creativity, structure, and teamwork. I believe that technology has the power to amplify creativity and build communities, and I am passionate about creating projects that inspire and connect people.

Combining my passion for the arts with my growing technical skills, I’m excited about the future of software development and the opportunities to contribute to projects that make a difference.
